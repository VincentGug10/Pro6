        <p class="about1">Our founder, Vinny Googs, grew up in Staten Island New York. After graduating college, he
            began to work on Wall Street.

            While he was indeed making a ton of money, he was no longer passionate about his job. <br>
            <br>

            He decided that starting fresh would be the best thing for himself.
            Since his favorite food group was fruit, he began to realize his dream.

            This is when The Açaí Shop was born.

            This is Vinny Googs sealing a multi-million dollar deal at his offices on Wall Street.

            Our acai and smoothie bowl franchise also maintains a commitment to educating customers about their own
            health. The goal is to emphasize a healthier life.
            The whole point is to eat wholesome, healthier food.<br>
            To that end, the business stocks 100% organic cold pressed apple juice, 100% organic coconut milk, granola,
            all natural peanut butter, coconut water, almond milk, and hemp milk.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br> Customers can choose a bowl from the menu or build an a la carte version, and a crowd favorite is the
            Bella Nutella.
            An acai bowl topped with granola, strawberry, banana, coconut flakes and Nutella drizzled on top. It’s not
            one of our healthiest options on the menu, but absolutely delicious!
